# [Counting Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-elements/)
**Note:** This problem is locked for premium subscriber on leetcode

**Goal:** 
Given an array `arr`, count the number of `x` that when `x + 1` will equal to a value also in `arr`

**Input:**
1. [1, 2, 3]
1. [1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7]
1. [1, 3, 2, 3, 5, 0]
1. [1, 1, 2, 2]

**Output:**
1. return 2, because 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 is 3, and both 2 and 3 are in the arr
1. return 0, because theres no 2, 4, 6, 8 in the arr
1. return 3, because there's 2, 3, 1 in arr
1. return 2, because 1 + 1 = 2, and 1 + 1 is 2 and there's 2 twos.

**constraints**
1 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Input: n/a pretty straightforward
Output: n/a pretty straightforward

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

1. Test when length of arr is 1
2. Test when return should be zero
3. Test when return is non-zero
4. Test when there's duplicates

## Pseudocode

**Approach 1 - Brute Force**
Time Complexity: O(n^2 ) as I traverse through the array in nested loop, (I am not sure if the sort function I am using will actually add to this.) 
Space: O(1) - no extra space used as it relates to n

1. sort original arr in ascending order
1. n <- arr.size(), count <- 0
1. for i <- 0 to n - 2
    - sum <- arr[i] + 1
    - for j <- i + 1 to n - 1
      - if arr[i] == sum
      - count++
1. return count

**Approach 2 - Using extra memory to create a set of unique values based on the array**
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space: O(n)

1. initiate an unordered_set so that the set will hold unique arr values
1. n <- arr.size(), count <- 0
1. for i <- 0 to n - 1
   - sum <- nums[i] + 1
   - if sum is in set
     - count <- count + 1

**Approach 3 - Sorting it first and then using 2 pointer method**

I struggled with this approach for a bit, but here's my initial thinking and I'll need to add to this, but this approach shouldn't need to use a set

Time Complexity: O(n) - n being the size of the array
Space: O(1)

1. sort original array
2. I know that once i sort it, the arr[n + 1] value is either:
   1. equal to arr[n]
      1. if it's equal, then I know I need to incremement one of the pointer because this is tracking the repeat
   2. greater arr[n] 
      1. if it's greater, but not equal to arr[n] + 1, then I continue with loop

Don't have the code yet formalized, but will continue.
