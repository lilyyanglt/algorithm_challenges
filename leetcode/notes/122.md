# [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

**Goal:** 
- Given array of nums `prices` for the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
- Design an algorithm to find max profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie. Buy one and sell share of the stock multiple times). You must sell stock before you buy again)

**Input:**
1. [7, 2, 5, 6, 1]
1. [1, 7, 8, 2, 3, 5]
1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
1. [3]
1. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
1. [7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

**Output:**
1. return 4, because buy at 2, sell at 5 that's 3, buy at 5 sell at 6 that's 1, therefore 3 + 1 = 4
1. return 10, because buy at 1, sell at 7, that's 6, buy at 7, sell at 8, that's 1, buy at 2, sell at 3, that's 1, buy at 3, sell at 5, that's 2 - 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10
1. return 5 
1. return 0
1. return 0
1. return 0

**Constraints**
1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4

## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
- I don't quite understand the note about being able to complete as many transactions as I like. Does this mean, that I can buy stock when it's at price say 1, and then sell it again and again? 
Answer: So no, it just means that say [1, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7] say these are your data and price of stock at day i, you can choose to buy on day i = 0, which is the lowest value, and then sell it say day i = 1, so profit is 1, then you can buy again the next day, so this is what it means to complete as many transaction as you like.

Output:
n/a

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

1. test when there's only 1 day of stock price - should return 0, since there's no day to sell
1. test when all stock values are the same - should return 0, since no profit will be earned
1. test when stock values decreases day by day - should return 0
1. test when stock values increases day by day - should return correct max profit
1. test when stock values are random up and down - should return correct max profit

## Pseudocode

1. n <- prices.size(), max_prof <- 0
1. for i < - 0 to n - 2
   - d <- prices[i + 1] - prices[i]
     - if d > 0, max_prof <- max_prof + d

smallest subproblem is: d = nums[i+1] - nums[i]

        for (int i=0;i<n-1;i++) {
            if (prices[i+1] > prices[i]) {
                difference = prices[i+1] - prices[i];
                max_profit += difference;
            }
        }
        
        return max_profit;
    }
};

## Other submission learnings and Solution Review

1. This solution is from Errichto 
- I actually have a very hard time understanding his solution, so might have to spend some more time to be able to explain what he's doing.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space: O(1)

```cpp

class Solution {
  const int INF = 1e9 + 5; // he created this to prevent overflow

  public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int best_without_stock = 0, best_with_stock = -INF;
      for (int x : prices) {
        best_with_stock = max(best_with_stock, best_without_stock - x);
        best_without_stock = max(best_without_stock, best_with_stock + x);
      }

      return best_without_stock;
    }
}

```

2. This is the approach and explanation by [chipbk10](https://leetcode.com/chipbk10/)
The profit is the sum of sub-profits. Each sub-profit is the difference between selling at day `j`, and buying at day `i` (with j > i). The range [i, j] should be chosen so that the sub-profit is maximum. 

`sub-profit = prices[j] - prices[i]`

so we should choose `j` that `prices[j]` is as big as possible, and choose `i` that `prices[i]` is as small as possible (of course in their local range). 

Say we have the range `[3, 2, 5]`, we will choose `(2, 5)` instead of `(3, 5)` because 2 < 3.
Now if you add 8 to the range `[3, 2, 5, 8]`, then you choose `[2, 8]`, because 8 > 5.

So as you can see, from day x, the buying day will be the last continuous day that the prices is smallest. Then, the selling day will be the last continuous day that the prices is biggest. 

Take another range `[3, 2, 5, 8, 1, 9]`, though `1` is the smallest, but `2` is chosen, because `2` is chosen, because `2` is the smallest in a consecutive decreasing prices starting from `3`. Similarly, `9` is the biggest, but `8` is chosen, because 8 is the biggest in a consecutive increasing prices starting from 2 (the buying prices). Actually the range `[3, 2, 5, 8, 1, 9]` will be splitted into 2 sub-ranges `[3, 2, 5, 8]` and `[1, 9]`.

```java

// author: https://leetcode.com/chipbk10/

public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int i = 0, buy = 0, sell = 0, profit = 0, N = prices.length - 1;
        while (i < N) {
            while (i < N && prices[i + 1] <= prices[i]) i++;
            buy = prices[i];

            while (i < N && prices[i + 1] > prices[i]) i++;
            sell = prices[i];

            profit += sell - buy;
        }
        return profit;
}

```


## Retro

Did Well:
- After I finished solving the question myself, I went to look at the solution and tried to compare how I did. It turns out that this is the first time, I have designed my algorithm very similar to the most optimal case. I don't quite understand though how come this is dp? is it because I am tracking the calculated profit along the way? I will need to study more about this. 
- The way I approached this problem is actually via the learnings I did in the Maximum Subarray problem where we used Kadane's algorithm, and instead of calculating the subarrays total lost or profit, I didn't need to do that, but I just now need to be able to proof why I didn't need to do that. 

Didn't do Well:
- I didn't account for a potential overflow of the maximum profit. When I continue to add profits, if the max element value is 10 ^ 4, and the length of the prices array is: 3 * 10 ^ 4, it could very well overflow. Max profit per transaction is 10^4, so I could get total profit of 10^4 * 3 * 10^4 ~= 10^8.
