# [Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/)
* Part of June Leetcode Challenges

**Goal:** 
* Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16) that sums up to n

**Input:**
* 12
* 13

**Output:**
* return 3, Explanation 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
* return 2, Explanation 4 + 9 = 13


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Idea: First intuition is this must be some kind of DP problem since I need to find the least number of perfect squares that sums up to n, so for instance, for the value 5, if you want to find the most perfect square, you would return 5 because 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup>, but the least would be first to get the max perfect
