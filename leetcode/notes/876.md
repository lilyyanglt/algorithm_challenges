# [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

**Goal:** 
Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return the middle node of the linked list, if there are 2 middle nodes, return the second one. 

The numer of nodes in a given list will be between 1 - 100

**Input:**
1. [1,2,3,4,5]
1. [1,2,3,4,5,6]
   
**Output:**
1. return node 3
2. return node 4


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
The example output for this question feels like it's asking me to return a node object, but it's actually asking for pointer to that node object, so just wanted to verify that I am returning the pointer to the middle node, not the object itself. 

Output:

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

1. Test when total number of node = 1
2. Test when total number of node = 100 - even number nodes
3. Test when total number of node = 5 - odd number of nodes

## Pseudocode

**Approach 1 - Brute force and double traversal**

1. Traverses the list once to find the total count of nodes
   1. count <- 0, temp <- head
   2. while temp is not null, loop until temp is null meaning I've reached the end of the list
   3. count <- count + 1 during each iteration
2. divide the count / 2 and get the floor of the value
3. reassign temp to head
4. while count != 0, count <- count - 1, temp <- temp.next
5. return temp as that would be pointing to the middle node

**Approach 2 - Using 2 pointer, start at the same location but one moves faster than the other**
* This method will guarantee that by the time fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, slow pointer will be half way, so it's the middle pointer that the question is looking for

1. Both slow and fast pointer start at the beginning with the head pointer
   1. slow <- head, fast <- head

1. while fast is not null
   1. fast <- fast->next
      1. if fast is null, already, we should return slow (this is for when the list only has 1 node)
   2. slow <- slow->next
   3. fast <- fast->next
1. return slow

**Approach 3 - Using Extra memory**
* This is just additional challenge to the same problem and different way to solve a problem.


## Outcome and Complexity Analysis

Approach 1 - Succeeded
* Time Complexity: O(n) - n being the total length of the list
* Space Complexity: O(1)
* Total time spent: 30 minutes

```cpp

// author: Lily yang

#include <math.h>

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode *head) {
        if (head->next == nullptr) return head;
        else {
            // find the total length of the linked list
            int count = 0;
            ListNode *temp = head;
            while (temp != nullptr) {
                count++;
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            
            // traverses the list again up to count/2 
            count = floor(count/2);
            temp = head;
            while (count != 0 ) {
                count--;
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            
            return temp;
        }
    }
};


```

Approach 2 - Succeeded, but it's actually the same amount of time as my approach 1
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space: O(1)

```cpp

// author: Inspired by Errichto's youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4OZZ3YLj4&t=29s
// I just changed the name of the variables to make it more clear

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        
        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            if (fast == nullptr) return slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
};

```

* The 2 pointer solution can be refactored even more to this

```cpp 

// author: https://leetcode.com/chih-chen/

class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
            ListNode* slow = head;
            ListNode* fast = head;

            while (fast && fast->next) {
                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next->next;
            }

            return slow;
        }
}

## Retro

**Learnings:**

- It appears that if I encounter a problem where I feel the need to double traverse a linear data structure, then think about using potentially 2 pointer method. 
  * Maybe one pointer will start at the front, and one starts at the end and they traverse at the same speed
  * Or both pointer will start at the same place, but one pointer moves faster than another. (Kind of like floyd cycle detection algorith, but you can use even if you are not looking for a cycle entrance)
