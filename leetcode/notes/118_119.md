## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 


Output:

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

## Code and Complexity Analysis

**Approach 1**

_pseudocode_



_cpp code_



_complexity analysis_

## Other submission learnings and Solution Review

* Need to understand how this O(k) space is working

__cpp__
```cpp

std::vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
  std::vector<int> output(rowIndex+1, 0);
  output[0] = 1;

  for(int i = 1; i < rowIndex + 1; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j >= i; j--) {
      output[j] += output[j-1];
    }
  }

  return output;
}

```

__python__

```python

def getRow(rowIndex):
  row = [1]

  for _ in range(rowIndex + 1):
    row = [x + y for x, y in zip[[0]+row, row+[0]]]

  return row

```
