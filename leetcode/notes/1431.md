# Kids with the greatest number of candies

GOAL: Determine which way to distribute the extraCandies among the kids so that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among other kids

INPUT: 
* candies: an array of integers that represents the number of candies each kid has currently
* extraCandies: a number to add to the existing candies of each kid

OUTPUT: 
* array of boolean values whether if each kid receives the extraCandies will have the greatest number of candies

Constraints:

* 2 <= candies.length <= 100
* 1 <= candies[i] <= 100
* 1 <= extraCandies <= 50

## Pseudocode:

**Approach 1: Brute Force exhaustive search each element**
* find the kid with the current max candy before adding the extra candy
* Then add candie to each kid and see if it will be greater than or equal to the original max candy
* replace candies[i] with true or false

1. max <- max of the array
2. output <- copy the candies array
3. for i <- 0 to n-1 
4. if candies[i] + extraCandies >= max
5. output[i] = true
6. else output[i] = false

## Code and Complexity Analysis

Approach 1: 
* Time: O(n) - because I am looping through each element 
* Space: O(n) - because the output array size is dependent on the size of the original candies array

```python

class Solution(object):
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies, extraCandies):
        """
        :type candies: List[int]
        :type extraCandies: int
        :rtype: List[bool]
        """
        
        greatest = max(candies) + extraCandies
        output = []
        for candies_total in candies:
            if candies_total + extraCandies < greatest:
                output.append(False)
            else:
                output.append(True)
                
        return output

```

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
        auto max = max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());
        int n = candies.size();
        vector<bool> output(candies.begin(), candies.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if(candies[i] + extraCandies >= *max) {
                output[i] = true;
            } else {
                output[i] = false;
            }
        }
        
        
        
        return output;
    }
};

```

Attempt 2: Succeeded
- I had to make a small change to my algorithm where I didn't need to add the extra candies to the greatest value because my goal was to find out who currently has the greatest number of candies
- then if I add the extra candies to any of the kids, whether they will then become the kid with the highest number of candies ie: their total candies (current + extra) should be >= greatest number from the original candies array

```python

class Solution(object):
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies, extraCandies):
        """
        :type candies: List[int]
        :type extraCandies: int
        :rtype: List[bool]
        """
        
        greatest = max(candies)
        output = []
        for candies_total in candies:
            output.append(False) if candies_total + extraCandies < greatest else output.append(True)
                
        return output

```
