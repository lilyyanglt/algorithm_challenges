# Kids with the greatest number of candies

GOAL: Determine which way to distribute the extraCandies among the kids so that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among other kids

INPUT: 
* candies: an array of integers that represents the number of candies each kid has currently
* extraCandies: a number to add to the existing candies of each kid

OUTPUT: 
* array of boolean values whether if each kid receives the extraCandies will have the greatest number of candies

Constraints:

2 <= candies.length <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50

## Pseudocode:

1. find the max element inside the candies array
2. greatest -> max ~~+ extraCandies~~
3. output -> []
4. i -> 0, for candies[i] + extraCandies
  i. if it's < greatest, output.push(false)
  ii. else output.push(true)
5. return output

__Complexity Analysis__

* Time: O(n) - because even though max() from python is O(n), not nesting it is not making it O(n^2) because it's just O(2 * n)
* Space: O(n) - because the output array size is dependent on the size of the original candies array

## Outcome

Attempt 1: Failed

```python

class Solution(object):
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies, extraCandies):
        """
        :type candies: List[int]
        :type extraCandies: int
        :rtype: List[bool]
        """
        
        greatest = max(candies) + extraCandies
        output = []
        for candies_total in candies:
            if candies_total + extraCandies < greatest:
                output.append(False)
            else:
                output.append(True)
                
        return output

```

Attempt 2: Succeeded
- I had to make a small change to my algorithm where I didn't need to add the extra candies to the greatest value because my goal was to find out who currently has the greatest number of candies
- then if I add the extra candies to any of the kids, whether they will then become the kid with the highest number of candies ie: their total candies (current + extra) should be >= greatest number from the original candies array

```python

class Solution(object):
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies, extraCandies):
        """
        :type candies: List[int]
        :type extraCandies: int
        :rtype: List[bool]
        """
        
        greatest = max(candies)
        output = []
        for candies_total in candies:
            output.append(False) if candies_total + extraCandies < greatest else output.append(True)
                
        return output

```
