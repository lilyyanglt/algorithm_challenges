# [Maximum Depth of a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
Double check if when there's only 1 node in the tree, do they consider that depth 1 or depth 0, in this question, because they are counting nodes as depths and not just edges, if there's 1 node, then its maximum depth is 1

if 1 node is considered having depth of 1, then empty tree is considered depth of 0

if 1 node is condiered having depth of 0, then empty tree is considered depth of -1

so the details shouldn't change in terms of how I implement this, but the base canse will change.

Output:

## Test Scenario

- use the test sample provided in the question
- empty tree
- tree with 1 node
- tree with left node and no right node
- tree with right node and no left node
