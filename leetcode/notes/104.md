# [Maximum Depth of a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
Double check if when there's only 1 node in the tree, do they consider that depth 1 or depth 0, in this question, because they are counting nodes as depths and not just edges, so that's why when there's 1 node, it's considered depth 1. 


Output:

## Test Scenario
