# [Detect Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/)

**Goal:** 
Return a boolean on whether a string is correctly capitalized.
A string is a correctly capitalized string only if the following rules are followed:

1. All letters are capitalized "USA"
2. Only first letter is capitalized "Flag"
3. All letters are lower case "flag"

Everything else should be false


## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - test general cases, base case, error case

Should return true for only the following pattern:
1. All letters are capitalized "USA"
2. Only first letter is capitalized "Flag"
3. All letters are lower case "flag"

Should return false for the following:
1. uSA
2. uuF
3. FlAG
4. ''


## Code and Complexity Analysis

**Approach 1**
set up 2 counting variables, count_upper, count_lower
set up a flag to track where capitalized letter was in the string: cap_found, cap_found_index
Loop through the string, 
if letter is 65 <= word[i] <= 90
  if cap_found is false, change to true and capture the index in cap_found_index
  count_upper <- count_upper + 1
else
  count_lower <- count_lower + 1

set up the rules using the variables to determine return value

_cpp code_

```cpp

 bool detectCapitalUse(string word) {
        int count_caps = 0, count_not_caps = 0, n = word.length(), cap_found_index;
        bool cap_found = false;
        
        if (n == 0) return false;
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (word[i] >= 65 && word[i] <= 90) {
                if(!cap_found) { 
                    cap_found = true;
                    cap_found_index = i;
                };
                count_caps++;
            } else count_not_caps++;
        }
        
        if((count_caps == 0 && count_not_caps == n) ||
           (count_caps == n && count_not_caps == 0) ||
           (count_caps == 1 && count_not_caps == n-1 && cap_found_index == 0)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
  }
```

_complexity analysis_

* Time - n is the length of string, so O(n)
* Space - even though I am using 5 variables, but throughout the algorith, it doesn't increase as n increases, so O(1)

## Other submission learnings and Solution Review

## Retro
- Total time: 1 hour
- I didn't test my algorithm for edge cases before implementation, so I should really try to do that as that took some additional time. "ffffG" returned true in my original algorithm.
