# [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
* Part of the June Leetcode Daily Challenge

**Goal:** 
- Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes
- a complete binary tree (according to wiki), is a tree where every level is filled, except possibly the last level, and the nodes at the last level are as far left as possible.

**Input:**
Using array as the representation, remember that for a complete binary tree
* left children: 2i + 1
* right children: 2i + 2

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

**Output:**
6


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: n/a

Output: n/a

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases
  
1. Test when tree is empty ie. root is NULL
2. Test when tree is not empty but only has root node ie return 1
3. Test when tree has more than root node ie. return > 1

## Pseudocode

There's 2 approaches to this problem, either goes through the tree iteratively or recursively

**Approach 1 - Recursive**

Time Complexity: TBD <br>
Space Complexity: O(1)

- the smallest subproblem here is when the node is null, so you return zero, else return 1 + left children + right children

## Outcome

Attempt 1 - Accepted, but I need to learn more about binary trees

```cpp

struct TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode *left;
  TreeNode *right;
  TreeNode(): val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
  TreeNode(int x): val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
  TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right): val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
  public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode *root) {
      if (root == nullptr) return 0;

      return 1 + countNodes(root->right) + countNodes(root->left);
    }
}

```
