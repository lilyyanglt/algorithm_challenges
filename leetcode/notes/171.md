# [excel sheet column number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)

**Goal:** 
Given a column as appear in an excel spreadsheet, return its corresponding column number.

## Test Scenario

Input -> Output:
'AB' -> 28
'ZY' -> 701
'ABC' -> 81

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

## Code and Complexity Analysis

**Approach 1**
- This problem is very similar to converting any other base into a decimal number. Each position have 26 potential options, meaning that it's in base 26. 

```
  A       B      C
26^2    26^1   26^0

so to calculate the decimal representation:

C * 26^0 = 3 * 26^0
B * 26^1 = 2 * 26^1
A * 26^2 = 1 * 26^2
``` 
* Knowing this is the pattern, we can do the following:
  1. Get length of string as n
  2. loop through the string n - 1 times
  3. Each time we can keep a variable that will be a power of 26
  4. Each time we loop, we are also tracking the sum
  5. note that Strings will all be CAPITAL letters, and the Ascii code for A - Z is 65 - 90, so we have to convert that to the corresponding values. A is 65 so take away 64 from all of them to get the corresponding decimal value. 

_cpp code_

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int titleToNumber(string s) {
        
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // using 16 bytes to prevent potential overflow
        long long power = 1; // this is like 26^0 is my initial power
        long long sum = 0;
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sum = sum + ((int)(s[i]) - 64) * power;
            // second loop will be 26^1...and so on 
            power*=26;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

_complexity analysis_
* Time: O(n) - n is the length of the string
* Space: O(1) - Space doesn't grow as the number of input increases

## Retro
- This took 1 hour to solve because I forgot how to convert base of any kind to decimal and got confused at one point.
