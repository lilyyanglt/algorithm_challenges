# [Add and Search Word - data structure design](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-and-search-word-data-structure-design/)

**Goal:** 
Design a data structure that supports the following operations:

void addWord(word)
bool search(word)

- the search function can allow for searching a literal word or a regular expression

## Brainstorm
1. I could use a hashtable with a-z as key and value is a set of words. Using a set so that there's no duplicate words
2. I could use a hashtable with a-z as the key and the value is a set but it's an implementation of a binary tree

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases
