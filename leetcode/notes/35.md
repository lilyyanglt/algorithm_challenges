# [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

**Goal:** 
Return the index of the target value (n) in a sorted array, if the target value is not found, return the index of where it would be if inserted in order. Assume no duplicates in the array

**Input and output:**
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]

if target = 5, return 2
if target = 7, return 4
if target = 0, return 0

nums = [1, 5, 7, 50]
if target is 39, return 3


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: Will input be a negative value?
n/a

Output:

Can i assume that if I were to return the index of where the value may be if it's not currently an element in the array, can i assume that it's increment of 1?

[1, 5, 6, 7]

target is 3, should this return index of 1 so that it would be [1, 3, 5, 7] or index of 2? [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

**Confirmation:**
should return index of 1

## Test Scenario

1. Test for target is in the nums array
1. Test for target should be inserted in middle of array
1. Test for target should be inserted at beginning of array, target is less than any element in the array
1. Test for target should be inserted at the very end of the array, bigger than any element in the array

## Pseudocode

__2 approaches__

Linear Approach
1. Traverse the array i <- 0 to nums.length - 1
1. if nums[i] == target; return i
1. else if nums[i] > target; return i
1. end the loop but can't find it, then that means the target is greater than any value in the array so it needs to be at the very end, return n

Binary Search Approach
1. mid = nums.length/2
1. while mid is not 0 or n - 1
1. check if nums[mid] == target; if true return mid
1. else if nums[mid] > target; update mid to mid + ((n - mid)/2)
1. else if nums[mid] < target; update mid to mid

## Complexity Analysis
Linear Approach
Runtime: O(n) = n is the size of array, I could potentially go through all the elements in the array to find that my target value is greater than all of the elements, so returning n eventually
Space: O(1) - no extra space is used

Bineary Search approach


## Outcome

Attempt 1: Success but trying to see if I can do better with approach 2

```cpp
// author: Lily Yang

class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (nums[n-1] < target) return n;
        
        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            if(target == nums[i] || nums[i] > target) return i;
        }
        
        return n;
    }
};


```
