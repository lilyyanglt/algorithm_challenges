# [Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)
* Part of June Leetcode challenge

**Goal:** 
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

**Input:**
[1,2,3]


**Output:**
return 25
root-to-leaf 1 > 2


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: Based on the input, can I expect all binary trees to be a complete binary tree where all levels are filled except the last and it's filled from as far left as possible? Just to confirm. 

Output:

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases
