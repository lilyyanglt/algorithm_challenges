# [Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)


**Goal:** 
You are given an array of integers where `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n`, some elements appear twice and others appear once, so you have to find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that don't appear in the array

Constraints: O(1) space and O(n) time

**Input:**
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:**
[5,6]


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
- can I use builtin methods to sort the input array first? 
- can the original list be changed?
- So just to clarify, the repeated elements in the array is there to fill the missing values? 
- `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n` - so this means that say i have array of length n = 8, then i should have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as elements inside the array

Output:
- does the output array need to be sorted?

## Pseudocode

First attempt based on misunderstanding of the question
1. sort the input array in-place
2. remove duplicates of the input array
3. missing_number_size = input_array[last_index] - length of array
4. create result vector with the missing_number_size length
5. for i, j -> 0 to n - 1 of the input_array
  - if input_array[i] !== i
  - get difference input_array[i] - i
    for k in range(difference)
      result_vector.pushback(i)
      j += 1
6. return results vector

Second attempt after understanding of the problem
1. get n equals to the length of the nums array
2. for i -> 1 to n 
    check if i is in nums list
    if not, add to results array

## Complexity Analysis
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1)

## Outcome

**Attempt 1: <span style="color:red">Failed!</span>**
- I misunderstood the question. So basically, the total number of elements will be equal to n of array except that there will be some elements missing, for instance:

[1, 1] = this is missing `2` because length of array is 2, and we only see 1, 1
if input is this [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] - i should actually have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] in the array, so the output is supposed to be [1, 5, 6, 7] which are the missing integers

__python__

```python

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums.sort()
        nums = list(dict.fromkeys(nums))
        result = []
        count = 1
        
        for value in nums:
            if count != value:
                difference = value - count
                for i in range(difference):
                    result.append(count)
                    count += 1
                count = value + 1
            else:
                count += 1
        return result
         
```

**Attempt 2: <span style="color:red">Failed!</span> Time limit exceeded**
Time Complexity: O(n^2) because the operator of checking whether x is in list is in itself O(n) and I am doing this n times, so n * n, gives me n^2

Although this gives me the correct output

```python

class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        
        return [x for x in range(1, n + 1) if x not in nums]

```

## Other submission learnings and Solution Review

- in order to make this O(1) space, people are using the existing array to mark the position of the elements and the missing values will somehow end up being a positive value inside the original input array. This is VERY CONFUSING, and I need to spend more time to understand the logic behind this.

But here are some solutions from others that worked beautifully

__cpp__

```cpp

// author: coder_cat - https://leetcode.com/coder_cat/

    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans;
		
        // 1st for loop: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)  // each iteration:
        {                                     // i = 0              i = 1               i = 2                ... i = 7
            int temp = nums[i];               // temp = 4           temp = 3            temp = -2            ... temp = -1
            temp = (temp > 0) ? temp : -temp; // temp = 4           temp = 3            temp = 2             ... temp = 1
            if(nums[temp-1] > 0)              // nums[3] > 0        nums[2] > 0         nums[1] > 0          ... nums[0] > 0
                nums[temp-1] *= -1;           // [4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1] [4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1] [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1] ... [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
        } 
		
		// 2nd for loop: nums = [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
            if(nums[i] > 0)         // the 4th & 5th indexes are positive
                ans.push_back(i+1); // ans = [5,6]
				
        return ans;
    }

```

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        for(int i=0; i<len; i++) {
            int m = abs(nums[i])-1; // index start from 0
            nums[m] = nums[m]>0 ? -nums[m] : nums[m];
        }
        vector<int> res;
        for(int i = 0; i<len; i++) {
            if(nums[i] > 0) res.push_back(i+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```

__java__

The basic idea is that we iterate through the input array and mark elements as negative using nums[nums[i] -1] = -nums[nums[i]-1]. In this way all the numbers that we have seen will be marked as negative. In the second iteration, if a value is not marked as negative, it implies we have never seen that index before, so just add it to the return list.

    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int val = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
            if(nums[val] > 0) {
                nums[val] = -nums[val];
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] > 0) {
                ret.add(i+1);
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }

```

__python__

Explaination from original author: 
For each number i in nums,
we mark the number that i points as negative.
Then we filter the list, get all the indexes
who points to a positive number.
Since those indexes are not visited.

        nums = [0] + nums
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            index = abs(nums[i])
