# [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

**Goal:** 
return a boolean (true or false) on whether integer n is a power of two

**Input:**
5

**Output:**
false


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: Can I assume that the input will be valid? - will there be negative values? 

Output: n/a

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

1. Test for when input is 0 or less, expected false
1. Test for when input is 1, expect true
1. Test for values not a power of 2 - e.g. 34 expecting false
1. Test for values that is a power of 2 e.g. 1024 expecting true


## Pseudocode

I've decided to go with a recursive approach on this one, but I am not sure if it's the best approach

1. identify the subproblem - i am actually not sure what the subproblem is in this case, but i think the recurrence relation is T(n) = T(n-k) * 2^k (NEED TO REVIEW MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION)
1. I can recursively call the function by reducing n by half, until i reach the base case, if I've reached 1, it's true, if I reached to a value that can't divide is an odd number, then I know for sure it's not a power of 2.

## Complexity Analysis

Runtime: O(nlogn) - n is the integer
Space: O(1)

## Outcome

Attemp 1: Succeeded - Recursion

```cpp

#include <math.h>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        
        if (n == 1) return true;
        if (n == 0 || n % 2 != 0) return false;
        
        return isPowerOfTwo(floor(n/2));
        
    }
};

```
