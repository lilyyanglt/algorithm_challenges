# [Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

**Goal:** 
Given an array of integers, `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n` (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

**Input:**
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

**Output:**
[2,3]


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: n/a

Output: Does the output have to be sorted like can the output be [3,2] instead of [2,3]? - If interviewer say that yes it needs to be sorted, I will just sort the output array before return, if they say no, then I don't have to worry

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

```cpp

  // Test case #1: n = 8, expected output [2,3]

  std::vector<int> nums = {4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1};

  nums = s->findDuplicates(nums);

  assert(nums[0] == 2);
  assert(nums[1] == 3);


  // Test case #2: n = 1, expected output []

  std::vector<int> nums2 = {1};

  std::vector<int> nums2_result(s->findDuplicates(num2));

  assert(nums2_result.size() == 0)


  // Test case #3: n = 2, expected output [2]

  std::vector<int> nums3 = {2,2};

  num3 = s->findDuplicates(nums3);

  assert(nums3[0] == 2);
```

**Approach 3 - As per question challenge, no extra space and O(n) runtime**
- Using similar approach as before for marking the index elements as negative, I will do the same here.
- each `nums[i] - 1` is going to be the index where the element of `nums[nums[i]-1]` is going to be marked negative, if nums[i] - 1 is going to nums[nums[i]-1] and the value is already negative, then nums[i] is the duplicate

_pseudocode_

1. result <- []
2. temp <- 0
3. for i <- 0 to n-1
   1. temp = nums[i]
   2. if nums[temp-1] < 0, it means that temp was seen already
      1. so result.add[temp]
      2. else nums[temp-1] <- nums[temp-1] * -1

_cpp code_

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> result;
        int temp = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            temp = abs(nums[i]);
            if (nums[temp-1] < 0) result.push_back(temp);
                nums[temp-1] *= -1;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

_complexity analysis_
Time Complexity: O(n) n is the size of the nums array
Space: O(1)
