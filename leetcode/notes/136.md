# [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

**Goal:** 
Given a non-empty array, every element will appear twice except for 1, find the one. Algorithm should have linear runtime complexity, and aim to implement it without using extra memory.

**Input:**
non-empty array
[2, 2]
[2, 2, 1]

**Output:**
return 0 for [2, 2]
return 1 for [2, 2, 1]


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
n/a

Output:
n/a

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

1. Test when array is just 1 element
1. Test when array has the value that's not repeating twice
1. Test when array has no value that's not repeating twice

## Pseudocode

1. Approach 1 - Brute force
  * n <- nums.size()
  * if n % 2 == 0, return 0 (this is because even number array will for sure don't have the value not repeating twice)
  * else if n == 1, return nums[n-1]
  * else set up hashmap: map
    - for i <- 0 to n-1
      - increment if key exists: map[n[i]] = map[n[i]] + 1
      - set up new key with value 1 if key don't exist: map[n[i]] = 1


2. Approach 2 - 

## Complexity Analysis

1. Approach 1 - Brute Force
Runtime: best case: O(1), worst case O(n)
Space: best case: O(1), worst case O(n) (NEED TO VERIFY because I am using c++ map, and feels like as I loop through the vector, I am increasing size of the map)

<hr>

1. Approach 2


## Outcome

Approach 1 - accepted, but not the best solution because I am using additional memory

```cpp

// inspired by Errichto

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            unordered_set<int> values;
            for(int x : nums) {
                
                // remove the current element from unordered set if it's already there
                if(values.count(x) == 1) {
                    values.erase(x);
                } else {
                    // so my unordered set will end up with just the unique element
                    values.insert(x);
                }
            }
            
            // dereference the pointer to get the value of the first item in the unordered set
           return *values.begin(); 
        
        }
        
    }
};

```

## Other submission learnings and Solution Review

* This first one is from the famous [Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg)
* It seems like he's using bit manipulation approach to solve this problem

```cpp

// author: Errichto

class Solution {
  public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
      int x = 0;
      for (int a : nums) {
        x ^= a;
      }
      return x;
    }
}

```

## Retro

June 15, 2020
- I need to get better at understanding bit manipulation and also the different data structures offered in C++ STL
- I didn't know how to use unordered_set and also didn't really understand errichto's approach.
