# [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Given a string, determine if it's a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
For the purpose of this problem, empty strings are considered a valid palindrome.


## Possible Questions to ask Interviewer when given this question

Input: 
Can I use built-in functions to check whether the characters are alphanumeric?

Output:

## Test Scenario

- Start planning the test cases - think about all the edge cases first and make sure your algorithm is designed in a way to handle all the edge cases

## Code and Complexity Analysis

**Approach 1**
- get rid of any non-alphanumeric characters
- using 2 pointer method, one at the beginning and one start at the end of the string and slowly move into the center and comparing whether the characters are equal to each other.
- I am using python just because it's much easier to remove the nonalpha numeric characters, or so I thought

_python code_

```python

import re

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        ns = re.sub(r'(\s)|(\W)', '', s).lower()
        ns = re.sub(r'_', '', ns)
        length = len(ns)//2 + 1
        temp = len(ns)
        
        for i in range(length):
            temp = temp - 1
            if ns[i] != ns[temp]:
                return False
            
        return True
```

_complexity analysis_
* Time: I am unsure of the complexity since I don't know what algorithm is used in re.sub()
* Space: I think it's O(1) because I am not using extra space as the length of string increases


**Approach 2**
- get rid of any non-alphanumeric characters
- run through each letter and keep a count of them in a hashmap, with the key being the characters and the value being the count of each character
- loop through the hashmap, if the length of string is odd, then there should only be 1 character that is a count of 1, if the length is even, then all character count should be even
