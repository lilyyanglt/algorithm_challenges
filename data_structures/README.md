# Data Structures

- I need to become more familiar with the different data structures in order to become more successful in solving algorithmic problems, so this section of the repo is focused mainly on the different basic data structures that are key to understanding more complex structures and algorithms. 

**Data Structures**

- Complex data structures such as trees, dynamic arrays, queues, graphs, hashtables, are all created by building blocks of static array and linked lists. 
- For example, a linked list structure is built using a node
- For example, dynamic arrays uses static array for its implementation
- For trees, it also uses node structure for its implementation
