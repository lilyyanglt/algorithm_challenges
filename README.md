# Algorithm Challenges

## Goal
- Practice solving problems through platforms like leetcode, codewars and hackerrank, and google. 
- Document my progress as I go and also learnings from other developers
- This repo is not intended to compare and constract the pros and cons of each of these platforms, but my hope is to get exposure into these different sites to better improve my skills.

## <span id="02"> Algorithms </span>
- This section documents the algorithms I learn from doing the different problems and also algorithms that I specifically take time to learn.

<br>

## <span id="03"> Data Structures </span>
- Contains data structures and the implementation of each data structure in java, cpp and python
- This section documents the data structures I learn from doing the different problems

<br>

## <span id="04">Unanswered questions</span>
- There will be times when I have questions but can't find the answer on the internet (which is rare), but I don't want to forget about the questions I have and hopefully they will be answered one day.

| Problem | Question |
| ------- | -------- |
| Codewars - Sum of Digits question | How to determine what the recurrence relation is for this problem if I am solving it recursively? |

## <span id="05">How to report implementation issues</span>
- If you spot any issues with the way I am implementing certain algorithms or data structures, or the information in terms of the complexity is incorrect, please open an issue and I will fix it. Thank you!
