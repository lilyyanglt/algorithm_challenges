# Algorithm Challenges

## Goal
- Practice solving problems through platforms like leetcode, codewars and hackerrank, and google. 
- Document my progress as I go and also learnings from other developers
- This repo is not intended to compare and constract the pros and cons of each of these platforms, but my hope is to get exposure into these different sites to better improve my skills.
