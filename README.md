# Algorithm Challenges (WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Goal
- Practice solving problems through platforms like leetcode, codewars,hackerrank, and google kickstart challenges. 
- Document my progress as I go and also learnings from other developers
- This repo is not intended to compare and constrast the pros and cons of each of these platforms, but my hope is to get exposure into these different sites to better improve my skills.

## [Algorithms](https://github.com/lilyyanglt/algorithm_challenges/tree/master/algorithms)
- This section documents the algorithms I learn from doing different problems.

## How to report implementation issues
- If you spot any issues with the way I am implementing certain algorithms or data structures, or the information in terms of the complexity is incorrect, please open an issue and I will fix it. Thank you!
